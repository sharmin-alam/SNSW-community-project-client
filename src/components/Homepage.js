            <p>My Community Project is a new initiative by the NSW Government to improve the wellbeing of people and communities in NSW. <br />
                <br />
            By having the ability to propose and vote on local projects, the people of NSW are given the opportunity to determine how to strengthen and improve their communities.<br />
                <br />
            My Community Project has been established using the Community Services and Facilities Fund within the NSW Generations Fund.<br />
                <br />
            The NSW Generations Fund is a new sovereign wealth fund for the State of NSW, created by the NSW Generations Fund Act 2018. The NSW Generations Fund helps keep the state’s debt at a sustainable level,
            while sharing the benefit of its returns with the people of NSW by funding community projects.<br />
                <br />
            The My Community Project funding will be distributed equally across all 93 NSW electorates. Applicants can seek between $20,000 and
            $200,000 (including GST, where applicable) for their project.</p>
